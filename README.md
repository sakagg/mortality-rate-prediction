Mortality rate prediction in ICU Patients

For decades, the number of ICUs has experienced a worldwide increase. The mortality assessment is crucial for making the critical decision of whether to interrupt the life-support treatments when intensive care is considered helpless.
Given time series data of the vital statistics of ICU Patients, we shall predict their likelihood of mortality.
Also, this prediction can help in deciding what treatment process to take.
We compared the results for 3 classifiers namely SVM, Linear Bayes, Neural Network with preprocessing the data using PCA.
We've adopted the work done in Physionet 2012 Challenge which can be found at: https://www.physionet.org/challenge/2012/papers/
Also, we trained our model using the XRCU dataset.
